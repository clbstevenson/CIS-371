    <p>The Hound of the Baskervilles by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (and You)</p>
    <p>"How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the back of your <span class="fillin" id="a01">Body Part</span>."</p>
    <p>"I have, at least, a well-polished, <span class="fillin" id="a02">Adjective</span> coffee-pot in front of me," said he. "But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor's <span class="fillin" id="a03">Noun</span>? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand, this <span class="fillin" id="a04">Adjective</span> souvenir becomes of importance. Let me hear you reconstruct the <span class="fillin" id="a05">Noun</span> by an examination of it."</p>
    <p>"I think," said I, following as far as I could the methods of my companion, "that Dr. <span class="fillin" id="b01">Last Name</span> is a successful, <span class="fillin" id="b02">Adjective</span> <span class="fillin" id="b03">Profession</span> man, well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation."</p>
    <p>"Good!" said Holmes. "<span class="fillin" id="c01">Exclamation</span>!" "I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country practitioner who does a great deal of his <span class="fillin" id="c02">Verb</span> on foot."</p>
    <p>"Why so?"</p>
    <p>"Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it. The thick-iron <span class="fillin" id="d01">Noun</span> is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a great amount of <span class="fillin" id="d02">ING Verb</span> with it."</p>
    <p>"<span class="fillin" id="e01">Exclamation</span>! said Holmes.</p>
